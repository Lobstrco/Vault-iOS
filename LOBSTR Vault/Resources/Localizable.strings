Developed by the creators of LOBSTR wallet - your favorite app for storing Lumens, LOBSTR Vault is the transaction signer app for your mobile device with the local key storage.

LOBSTR Vault uses multisignature technology of the Stellar Network and allows you to create a local signer account and verify transactions from multiple accounts on the Stellar Network.

Your secret key is fully encrypted, securely stored in the local storage and never touches our servers.

The app uses the secret key to sign transactions on-device - you make the final decision to 'Confirm' or 'Deny' the transaction.

Quick and easy to use, LOBSTR Vault is an open source app that fully integrates with LOBSTR wallet and takes the security of your Stellar account to the next level.

You can find the 'Multisig' option under the 'Settings' tab in LOBSTR wallet.

With LOBSTR wallet integration, there is no need to import Transaction XDRs. Your pending outgoing transactions will appear in the signing LOBSTR Vault account in a matter of seconds.

LOBSTR Vault supports push notifications to help you to stay up-to-date with your transaction 'sign' requests.

A custom 6-digit PIN and your biometric authentication help keeping your signer account safe.
";
"help_chapter2_title" = "2. Intro to Multisignature concept";
"help_chapter2_description" = "
Stellar Network uses signatures as authorization. Transactions always need authorization from at least one public key in order to be considered valid.

Typically transactions only involve operations on a single account. For example, if account A wanted to send lumens to account B, only account A needs to authorize the transaction.

Transaction signatures are created by cryptographically signing the transaction object contents with a secret key.

A transaction with an attached signature is considered to have authorization from that public key or Stellar account.

In two cases, a transaction may need more than one signature:

- If the transaction has operations that affect more than one account, it will need authorization from every account in question.
- A transaction will also need additional signatures if the account associated with the transaction has multiple singers. That is where the multisignature comes in.


Multisignature (or “multisig”) concept presumes that account requires two or more secret key signatures before allowing a transaction to occur on the account.

For example, two people want to have a joint account so that any transactions made from that account first requires both parties to agree and sign them before it can be submitted.

This increases the security of account, as long as the two or more secret keys are stored separately.


Transactions on the Stellar Network are made up of a list of operations but mostly include only one operation.

Each operation falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium, or high. Each threshold defines the combined amount of signature weight an operation needs in order to succeed.

Each account can set its own threshold values. By default, all thresholds levels are set to 0, and the master key is set to weight 1.

For the sake of simplicity of use and additional security, at the time of multisig setup, LOBSTR currently sets identical values for all threshold categories and increases them evenly with the addition of new signers.

Be careful and use caution when changing your accounts thresholds in other services as this may lead to a permanent block of your account and a loss of your funds!


For all Stellar wallets, the private key that corresponds to its public key is called the master key.

Each master key can be assigned a weight also referred to as the signature weight of that account.

Each signer account also has its own signature weight.

In the multisig setup using LOBSTR Vault and LOBSTR wallet, signature weights of signer keys are the same as the weight of the master key of the primary account.


For the multisig-enabled account, all operations like payments, adding trustlines, updating weights and others will require two or more signatures - one from your account and one or more additional signatures from your signers.

That is where you will need LOBSTR Vault app.

"help_chapter3_title" = "3. What is a Recovery Phrase?";
"help_chapter3_description" = "
A Recovery Phrase, 12 Words Backup, Seed Phrase or the seed represent the same thing and have many more names in the cryptocurrency ecosystem which may be misleading.

LOBSTR Vault uses the term 'Recovery Phrase'.

Recovery Phrase is a list of 12 or 24 words that represent the single secret piece of data that is used to generate both the public and private key of your account.

You are the only one who has access to your Recovery Phrase.

You will need these words to restore access to your LOBSTR Vault account in case your phone is lost or stolen.

Your 12 or 24-word Recovery Phrase is stored in an encrypted manner on the device you install LOBSTR Vault on.

We do not store your Recovery Phrase on our servers, nor do we have any access to it.


The order of the words in the Recovery Phase is very important!

Make sure to write down the Recovery Phrase in the correct order without any spelling mistakes:

- Start from the word in the top left corner and follow the line to the last word
- Transition down to the next line and start with the first word on the left
- Continue until every word is written down

Write down these 12 words on a piece of paper or print them using a secure printer.

A smart move is to create multiple copies of your Recovery Phase and store it in multiple locations to prevent an inadvertent loss.


You will not be able to access your account without this phrase. Entering the phrase incorrectly will result in you not being able to access your account!

A loss of your Recovery Phrase may also result in your main account not being able to function properly as you will not be able to sign outgoing transactions!

Anybody else who discovers the phrase can access your signer account, so it must be kept safe like your other valuables. It must not be stored in any electronic or digital form.

Do not email or screenshot the Recovery Phrase.
";
"help_chapter4_title" = "4. Where can I find my public key?";
"help_chapter4_description" = "
Every Stellar account has a public key and a secret seed (Recovery Phrase).

The public key is always safe to share — other people need it to identify your account and verify that you authorized a transaction.

You will also need your Vault public key to set up the multisig solution in LOBSTR wallet.

If you are currently setting up or recovering your LOBSTR Vault account, you can find your public key at the 'Your Vault Public Key' screen.

Use the 'Copy Key' button to transfer your key. The QR-code contains your Vault public key as well - you can scan it using your LOBSTR wallet app on another device.

If you are already inside your LOBSTR Vault account, you can find your Vault public key at the 'Home' screen or in the 'Account' section of the 'Settings' screen.


If you try to find your account using a network explorer like StellarExpert, you may receive a message that your account does not exist on Stellar ledger.

Do not worry, your account is safe. It is stored locally in LOBSTR Vault app. The account does not need to actually exist on the Stellar Network to act as a signer for your main account.

If you want to use your LOBSTR Vault account as a wallet, you would need to create and fund this account at first.

The seed or Recovery Phrase is the single secret piece of data that is used to generate both the public and private key for your account.

LOBSTR Vault uses the Recovery Phrase instead of the private key for your convenience. To have full access to your account, you only need to provide a seed instead of both a public key and a private key.

A private key is still stored locally and used to encrypt data and sign transactions.

LOBSTR Vault is not a wallet app and does not expose the private key for security reasons.

If you need the private key of your LOBSTR Vault account, you would need to derive it from your 12-word Recovery Phrase using third party tools.
";
"help_chapter6_title" = "6. What is a Transaction XDR?";
"help_chapter6_description" = "
XDR, also known as External Data Representation, is a binary serialization data format used extensively in the Stellar Network.

The ledger, transactions, results, history, and other data on the Stellar Network are encoded using XDR.

Transactions are the basic unit of change in the Stellar Network and are essentially a grouping of operations.

Transaсtions can include one or more operations.


If you have a multisig solution configured on your account, your service or wallet may provide you with Transaction Envelope XDR string.

You may treat this string as the desired transaction signed using the secret key of your account. You will need one or more additional signatures for this transaction to occur.

This string should be provided to the owner of signing account and imported to the signing service, like LOBSTR Vault.

The good news is that LOBSTR Vault saves you time and manages this process automatically - you won't need to add the Transaction XDR manually.

If you use a combination of LOBSTR wallet and LOBSTR Vault apps, your pending outgoing transaction will appear in the signing LOBSTR Vault account in a matter of seconds.

The owner of the signer account will be alerted via a push notification on the signing device.

In order to recover your LOBSTR Vault account, you should have your Recovery Phrase you've written down when you created your account.

Our company does not have access to your Recovery Phrase.

It is securely stored in the local storage of your phone until you log out from your LOBSTR Vault account or remove the app.

If you ever lose your phone, remove LOBSTR Vault app accidentally or can't access your account for any reason, you can restore the account using the 12-word Recovery Phrase.


Follow the steps below to recover your LOBSTR Vault account:

1. Install LOBSTR Vault app on your iOS or Android device and open it.
2. Choose the Recover Account option.
3. Enter the 12-word Recovery Phrase you've written down when you created your account.
- The word order is very important. Enter the Recovery Phrase in the correct order without any spelling mistakes.
4. If the Recovery Phrase is entered correctly, the 'Next' button should become active.
5. Set up your custom 6-digit PIN.
6. Enable biometric authentication, if required.

If your account is a signer for another Stellar Account and you followed the steps correctly, the recovery process should now be complete.

If your account is not a signer for another Stellar Account, you will be transitioned to the 'Your Vault Public Key' screen.

To access your LOBSTR Vault account, you will need to set up a multisig solution on your main account at first.


You can use the Recover Account option to access the account (signer) created in another signer service, for example, StellarGuard.

Such service should provide the BIP-039 generated 12 or 24-word Recovery Phrase.

You should configure the multisig solution at the LOBSTR side for the system to function properly.

8. You will be transitioned to the screen with the Vault public key and the QR code.
9. In LOBSTR wallet app, open the 'Settings' screen and select the 'Multisig' option.
10. Tap 'Enable Multisig' button.
11. LOBSTR wallet should detect LOBSTR Vault account automatically and prompt to use it.
12. Tap 'Yes, Use This Device' button.
13. At this step, you will need to confirm that you want to add a new signer to your Stellar account. Carefully read the description and tap the 'Continue' button.
14. If the 'Multisig enabled' screen is displayed, the singer account should be successfully added to your Stellar account.
15. To complete the setup at LOBSTR Vault side, open the app and tap the 'Next' button at the screen with your Vault public key.
16. If required, tap the 'Re-Check' button at the next screen.
17. You will be transitioned to the 'Home' screen of LOBSTR Vault app.

If you have multisig enabled for your Stellar account and try to make a transaction, you may be provided with a Transaction XDR by your wallet or signer service.

It is likely that you need additional signatures for this transaction to occur on your account.

If you are using the combination of LOBSTR Wallet and LOBSTR Vault apps, transaction 'sign' requests should appear automatically in LOBSTR Vault in most cases - there is no need to import Transaction XDRs.

If you are using other service and need to add and sign a Transaction XDR in LOBSTR Vault app, follow the steps below:

1. Select the 'Transactions' screen in the main navigation.
2. Tap the '+' floating button.
3. Paste your Transaction XDR into the input field of 'Add Transaction XDR' form.
4. Tap the 'Submit' button.

If the 'Success' screen is displayed - your transaction should be successfully signed.

You may be provided with another Transaction XDR if you need more signatures on this transaction.


If the 'Add Transaction XDR' form displays errors or the 'Submit' button is disabled:

- Make sure you've copied the Transaction XDR correctly - there should be no spaces before and after the XDR string.
- Make sure you are using the correct XDR - a transaction is considered invalid if it includes signatures that aren't needed to authorize the transaction.

1. Select the 'Settings' screen in the main navigation
2. Select the 'Change PIN' option in the 'Security' section
3. Enter your current PIN
4. Enter your new desired PIN
5. Confirm your new desired PIN


If you can't remember your PIN or your biometric authentication does not match, you will need to go through the recovery process in order to access your account.

There is currently no ability to request a PIN reset in LOBSTR Vault app.

Before you log out from your LOBSTR Vault account, make sure you have secured your Recovery Phrase. You will not be able to recover your account or sign in without your Recovery Phrase - your account will be lost.

If the main Stellar account has multiple signers, you may see a message that more signatures are needed for the transaction to occur at the 'Success' screen.

In most cases, this means that other signers for the main account should provide their signatures by 'Confirming' the transaction.

Such transaction will not occur on the Stellar Network until it is signed by all signers including the main account.

If you are using the combination of LOBSTR Wallet and LOBSTR Vault apps, all signers will be notified of the transaction 'sign' requests automatically.


In case you need more signatures, the 'Success' screen will also display a Transaction XDR.

You may treat this string as the desired transaction signed using the secret key of your LOBSTR Vault account.

"help_chapter13_title" = "13. Invalid sequence number";
"help_chapter13_description" = "
Each transaction on the Stellar Network has a sequence number. Transactions follow a strict ordering rule when it comes to processing of transactions for each account.

For a transaction to be valid, the sequence number must be strictly 1 greater than the sequence number stored in the source account entry when the transaction is applied.

In the multisig setup using LOBSTR Vault and LOBSTR wallet, the source account is the Stellar account used in LOBSTR wallet.


For accounts with multisig setup, there is a probability of multiple unsigned transactions existing with the same sequence number, waiting to be signed and submitted to the Stellar Network.

Such transactions do not exist on the Stellar Network until all signatures are provided.

Only one of those transactions can ultimately occur on the Stellar Network with the given sequence number.

Once one of those transactions is accepted and applied to the ledger, other transactions will be rendered invalid and will not be accepted by the Stellar Network.

An attempt to sign a transaction with an outdated sequence number in LOBSTR Vault will fail with the 'Sequence number does not match source account' message.

You will need to remove such transactions from your transaction list manually by choosing the 'Deny' option at the 'Transaction Details' screen


An attempt to sign a transaction will also fail for the same reason if the sequence number is greater than the sequence number stored in the source account entry by 2 or more.

In this case, a transaction will be considered valid once the sequence number stored in the source account entry reaches the required value.
